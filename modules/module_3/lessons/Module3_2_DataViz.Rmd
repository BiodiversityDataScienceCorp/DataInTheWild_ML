# A Visualization Primer

Some figures to whet your palate:\

[Here](https://extremepresentation.typepad.com/files/choosing-a-good-chart-09.pdf) is a decent overview of some of the core concepts of data visualization.

## Why Does Data Visualization Matter?

### On your own 
Take 3 minutes to write down your top 5 reasons why data visualization is important or useful to you

### Small Groups
As a group, take 5 minutes to compare your notes and come to a group consensus on your top 5 reasons. Be sure to choose someone to report out!

## Types of Visualization

### Small group activity

In groups, discuss all of the types of visualization you can think of--it's ok if you don't know what they are called! Make a quick list. Draw them out if you prefer.

Data Visualization Types:

### Data matching activity

Open the PDF called "data_viz_matching_exercise." Spend a few minutes figuring out which data visualization matches which data type.

## Figure Critique

First, read through [this blog post](https://humansofdata.atlan.com/2019/02/dos-donts-data-visualization/) on the "Dos and Don'ts of Data Visualization"

Now that you have some insights, let's critique these figures below. Yes, these are actual figures in the wild...

-   what aspects don't work
-   what aspects do work
-   how how you present the data?
