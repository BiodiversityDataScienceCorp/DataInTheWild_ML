# A Visualization Primer

Some figures to whet your palate:\

[Here](https://extremepresentation.typepad.com/files/choosing-a-good-chart-09.pdf) is a decent overview of some of the core concepts of data visualization.

## Why Does Data Visualization Matter?

### On your own

Take 3 minutes to write down your top 5 reasons why data visualization is important or useful to you

### Small Groups

As a group, take 5 minutes to compare your notes and come to a group consensus on your top 5 reasons. Be sure to choose someone to report out!

## Types of Visualization

### Small group activity

In groups, discuss as many all types of visualization that come to mind. It's ok if you don't know what they are called! Make a quick list or draw them out if you prefer.

### Data matching activity

Still in your groups, open the PDF called "data_viz_matching_exercise"

Spend a few minutes seeing if you can match the data descriptions to the types of data visualizations. Note: these plots do not represent the data, just a type of data visualization.

This is a challenging exercise, so don't panic if you feel a little lost! Here are some things to help you think through which visualizations might be appropriate:

-   how many variables are in the data description?
-   how many variables are represented in the data visualization? Look at the axes, sizes, colors, etc.
-   how is *one* data point represented on the plot?
-   how is variation in the data represented on the plot, if at all?

## Figure Critique

First, read through [this blog post](https://humansofdata.atlan.com/2019/02/dos-donts-data-visualization/) on the "Dos and Don'ts of Data Visualization"

Now that you have some insights, let's critique these figures below. Yes, these are actual figures in the wild...

-   what aspects don't work
-   what aspects do work
-   how how you present the data?

## Plotting in `ggplot2`

Hopefully you're excited to keep using `ggplot2` to make clean, interpretable data visualizations! With the remaining time in class, spend some time trying to recreate the plots you made in Module 2 Assignment 1. Try to recreate both histogram and the scatterplot.

```{r}
# load the tidyverse package and the penguins package

```
