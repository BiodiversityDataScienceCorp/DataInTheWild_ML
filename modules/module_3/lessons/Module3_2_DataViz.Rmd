## Why Does Data Visualization Matter?

On your own: take 3 minutes to write down your top 5 reasons why data visualization is important or useful to you

Let's break up into small groups. 

As a group, take 5 minutes to compare your notes and come to a group consensus on your top 5 reasons. Be sure to choose someone to report out!

## Types of Visualization

Small group activity

In groups, discuss all of the types of visualization you can think of--it's ok if you don't know what they are called! Make a quick list.

#### 1b.2 Activity - matching data types to visualization types

Matching activity in group - can you match the visualization to the data type.

File for activity is in the images folder.

## Figure Critique

First, read through (this blog post)[https://humansofdata.atlan.com/2019/02/dos-donts-data-visualization/] on the "Dos and Don'ts of Data Visualization"

Now that you have some insights, let's critique these figures below. Yes, these are actual figures in the wild...

 * what aspects don't work
 * what aspects do work
 * how how you present the data?
