## Bonus Content

Looking for a bit more of a challenge? We won't be covering any of the "Bonus Content" in class, but this can be a way to expand your knowledge if you are interested. Answer keys will be posted at the end of the module.

First, figure out how to add your own code chunks into this document. Then, start exploring [this website](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/r-plot-pch-symbols-the-different-point-shapes-available-in-r) for some additional information on how to customize histograms and scatter plots in base R.

See if you can recreate the following plots:

### Plot 1: Histogram

Check about the function `abline()` to add in the line representing the mean value. As a note, you will need to run the entire code chunk to successfully create this plot (it doesn't play nicely with in-line outputs).

### Plot 2: Scatter Plot

I don't condone this way of plotting as good data visualization, but it is fun to create.
