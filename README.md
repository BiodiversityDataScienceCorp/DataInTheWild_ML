# WFSC 223: Data in the Wild

This is a repository for the code, materials and data for *Data in the Wild* (WFSC 223), which was designed to introduce life science majors to basic programming, statistics, and machine learning. This course was developed by Drs. Katy Prudic, Jeff Oliver, and Keaton Wilson. This was taught in pilot form at the University of Arizona in Spring 2020 as *Settlers of Antarctica*.

The challenges and syllabus outline five modules, but due to the pilot nature of the course (and complications with the Covid-19 pandemic) only the first four modules were developed and administered.
